   ```bash
   # On GitHub, click the "Fork" button
   ```

2. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ultra-fast-ip-generator.git
   cd ultra-fast-ip-generator
   ```

3. **Add the upstream remote**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/ultra-fast-ip-generator.git
   ```

4. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run basic functionality tests
go run ultra_fast_ip_generator.go 1000
go run fast_ip_generator.go 1000  
go run ip_generator.go 1000

# Test compilation
go build ultra_fast_ip_generator.go
go build fast_ip_generator.go
go build ip_generator.go

# Format code
go fmt ./...

# Check for issues
go vet ./...
```

### Code Style

- Follow standard Go formatting (`go fmt`)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use error handling appropriately

### Performance Considerations

- Benchmark any performance-critical changes
- Consider memory usage for large datasets
- Test with various input sizes (1K, 100K, 1M, 10M+ IPs)
- Profile memory and CPU usage when applicable

## Git Workflow

### Branch Naming
- `feature/description` - for new features
- `bugfix/description` - for bug fixes
- `docs/description` - for documentation updates
- `performance/description` - for performance improvements

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Examples:
```
feat: add IPv6 support to ultra-fast generator
fix: resolve memory leak in batch processing
docs: update performance benchmarks in README
perf: optimize IP validation algorithm
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** if your changes affect user-facing functionality
2. **Add tests** if you're adding new functionality
3. **Ensure all tests pass** and code compiles successfully
4. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with details of changes
5. **Request review** from maintainers
6. **Address feedback** and make necessary changes
7. **Squash commits** if requested before merging

## Performance Benchmarking

When contributing performance improvements:

1. **Benchmark before and after**
   ```bash
   # Example benchmarking
   time go run ultra_fast_ip_generator.go 1000000
   ```

2. **Test with various sizes**
   - Small: 1K - 10K IPs
   - Medium: 100K - 1M IPs  
   - Large: 10M+ IPs

3. **Monitor resource usage**
   ```bash
   # Monitor memory usage
   /usr/bin/time -v go run ultra_fast_ip_generator.go 1000000
   ```

4. **Document improvements** in pull request description
